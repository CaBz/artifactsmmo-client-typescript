# Roadmap for success

1. Finish generating all entities
1. Add logic to check inventory for consumables instead of resting - Resting should be last resort
1. Add logic to figure out the best equipment to beat a monster (Combo of building dynamic sets + fight simulator)
1. Remove hardcoded list of point of interests and convert into auto-generated values
1. Remove dynamizable workflows from the static workflows
1. Reduce calls to get character status by passing the value between all workflow actions
1. Build a on-the-fly workflow based on updated context and make actions less generic
